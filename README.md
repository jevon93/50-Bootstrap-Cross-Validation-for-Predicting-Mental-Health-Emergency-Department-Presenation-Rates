# Monte Carlo Cross-Validations

This code demonstrates how to use Monte Carlo Cross Validation, which cuts the data into random segments a large number of times and then cross-validates them against each other to make accurate predictions.

As this analysis was the part of a large report, please contact me via e-mail if you are interested in the full 20-page analysis. The data used in this analysis is only accessible at a specific location. Therefore this code is here to display the general framework to create a predictive model using Monte Carlo Cross Validation.
